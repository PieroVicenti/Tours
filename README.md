## Project's goals

Project created to test React features.
The idea is to show a travel agency page, which shows some possible trips.
As per project, there is the chance to read more about the destination and the chance to remove the trip if the user does not like it.
If the user removes all the shown trip, a new button will appear giving the chance to refresh and restore all the deleted trips.
